        <p>Industry Leading Security Features</p>
        <p>
            Messages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at
            all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user
            devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.
        </p>

        <p>Zero Access to Your Email Content</p>
        <p>
            Proton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in
            a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side
            using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we
            don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.
        </p>

        <p>Open-Source Cryptography</p>
        <p>
            Proton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security
            experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection.
            Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with
            OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By
            using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption
            algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.
        </p>

        <p>Proton Mail in the press:</p>
        <p>
            “Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption,
            making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes
        </p>

        <p>
            “A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN
            promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive
            information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post
